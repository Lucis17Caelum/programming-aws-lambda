Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 

Code examples for programming AWS Lambda with different programming languages:

- Node.js / JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- C#

The code samples were created using the serverless framework (for Node.js, Python), Eclipse (for Java), and Visual Studio 2015 (for C#), respectively.

A video tutorial that I recorded in March 2017 can be purchased via Pack Publishing: <https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learning-aws-lambda-video>. In the video, I explain the basic programming and deployment model for AWS Lambda and I show how to combine AWS Lambda with other AWS services, in particular, with API Gateway Service, DynamoDB, and S3, using different programming languages for implementing the business logic. The focus of the video is on JavaScipt/Node.js (Volume I) but I also give a short introduction to programming AWS Lambda (in combination with different AWS services) using Java with Eclipse, Python with serverless framework, and C# with .NET and Visual Studio (Volume II).
